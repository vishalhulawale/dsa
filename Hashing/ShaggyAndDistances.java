/*
Shaggy and distances

Problem Description
Shaggy has an array A consisting of N elements. We call a pair of distinct indices in that array a special if elements at those indices in the array are equal.
Shaggy wants you to find a special pair such that the distance between that pair is minimum. Distance between two indices is defined as |i-j|. If there is no special pair in the array, then return -1.


Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 10^5


Input Format
The first and only argument is an integer array A.


Output Format
Return one integer corresponding to the minimum possible distance between a special pair.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = [7, 1, 3, 4, 1, 7]

Input 2:
A = [1, 1]

Example Output
Output 1:
3

Output 2:
1

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Here we have 2 options:
1. A[1] and A[4] are both 1 so (1,4) is a special pair and |1-4|=3.
2. A[0] and A[5] are both 7 so (0,5) is a special pair and |0-5|=5.
Therefore the minimum possible distance is 3. 

Explanation 2:
Only possibility is choosing A[1] and A[2].
